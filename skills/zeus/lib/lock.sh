# lock.sh — the family's advisory file lock. SOURCE this (don't execute). Defines
# with_lock; sets no shell options and runs no top-level code. This is the ONE copy
# (four byte-identical with_lock copies used to live in the skills).
#
# It is mkdir-based (atomic), steals a dead holder's lock (PID check), and cleans up
# via an EXIT trap, so a short-lived script invocation acquires once and releases
# when it exits.

# with_lock <lock_dir> — block until the lock is held, then take it. A ~5s timeout
# (50 × 0.1s) steals a presumed-dead lock so a holder that died without cleanup
# can't deadlock the family. Use around a read-modify-write of shared state.
